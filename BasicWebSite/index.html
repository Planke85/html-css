                <h3 class="title">Welcome to the Herding Rescue Dogs of Wyoming<br>
                    (and beyond!)
                </h3>
                <p>HeRD of WY, Inc. is a registered 501c3 non-profit organization that seeks to help unwanted dogs find appropriate and loving homes. HeRD of WY was formally organized in 2008 out of the recognition that there are many herding breed dogs and mixes that "fall through the cracks” in Wyoming. Herding dogs often struggle in certain homes and shelter environments due to their high energy, intelligence and sensitivity, and then have no safe place to go. The program has been so successful that HeRD now has active foster homes and relationships with shelters in six states and our adopters come from all over North America!</p>

                <p>We always have so many deserving dogs available for adoption, please check out our Available Dogs page as you search for your next herding dog!
                </p>

                <p>In addition to forever homes, HeRD of WY is always in need of volunteers and donations in many forms. Please visit the Ways to Help page to find out what you can do today! <a class="donate" href="#">Donate</a> </p>
            </article>

            <aside>
                <p>The Available Dogs page is updated daily . Because we are completely volunteer-beased, we respectfully ask that if you are interested in adopting a dog, you please first fill out and submit an application before contacting us. Allow up to 2 weeks for processing.
                </p>

                <h2>What does HeRD do?</h2>

                <h3 class="title">RESCUE​ BASICS</h3>

                <p>HeRD of WY focuses primarily on the rescue of Australian Shepherds, Border Collies, Australian Cattle Dogs and mixes thereof. However, it is not uncommon for us to assist or place other herding breed dogs (collies, shelties, bearded collies, corgis, kelpies, mcnabs, etc.) and mixes as well.  Services include removing dogs from shelters where they are deteriorating or in danger and placing them in volunteer foster homes throughout the Mountain West (Wyoming and its bordering states, excluding Colorado). The rescue then supports foster homes to assess temperaments, behaviors, and special needs.   The dogs are provided with appropriate veterinary care and emotional rehabilitation and ultimately placed in appropriate forever homes.  Finally, HeRD of WY offers follow-up support to adoptive homes as necessary.</p><br>

                <h3 class="title">OWNER SURRENDER POLICY</h3>

                <p>HeRD of WY is not a shelter, does not have a central facility, and does not receive government financial support.  HeRD of WY is a volunteer-based, 501c3 nonprofit organization that relies on foster homes.  As such, we are not able to accept owner-surrenders.  However, if you are willing to "foster" your own dog while we work to place your dog by listing your dog and screening for appropriate homes, please email quality pictures of your dog, your contact number, and a detailed biography (reason for wishing to surrender your dog, age, breed, positive qualities, specialized training, any history of aggression to people or animals, challenging habits, and any other information helpful in matching your dog with the correct home).  HeRD of WY reserves the right to refuse any owner listing at the sole discretion of its directors.</p><br>

                <h3 class="title">ADOPTION FEES</h3>

                <p>HeRD of WY requires an adoption fee for the adoption of any dog from the program.  This fee may range from as low as $100 up to $225.  These fees help cover the veterinary expenses of spay/neuter, vaccinations, dentals, etc. incurred in preparing the dogs for their forever home.  If you cannot afford this fee, you may need to consider the overall cost of having a dog and whether this is the appropriate time for you to adopt a dog.</p><br>

                <h3 class="title">RETURNS/TRIAL ADOPTIONS</h3>

                <p>HeRD of WY endeavors to make every placement a forever home.  In the interest of not bouncing dogs around and causing further trauma, we do not generally do trial placements.  We ask that persons looking to adopt seriously consider their readiness to adopt and share any reservations about adopting with the rescue contact.  However, in the event that an adoption does not work out at any point or for any reason, HeRD of WY will take back and in fact requires the return of the dog to HeRD.  Any further placement or rehoming of HeRD alumni outside of HeRD of WY is strictly forbidden.  Refund of adoption fees for returned dogs will vary dependent upon the circumstances and will be at the sole discretion of HeRD of WY representatives.</p><br>

                <h3 class="title">OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS</h3>

                <p>HeRD of WY is happy to work with out of state adopters.  All adopters must be willing to complete an application, allow a home visit, and travel to the foster location to adopt.  HeRD does not ship dogs to other locations.  Due to the regressive policies of PACFA, HeRD of WY does not do adoptions in the state of Colorado, but Colorado residents are welcome to travel to Wyoming to adopt from HeRD of WY.</p><br>
